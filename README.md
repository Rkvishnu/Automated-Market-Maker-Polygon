# Web3-QnA-Forum-with-Polygon-AMM

# About:
1.A web3 version of the popular platform "Stake-Overflow" that allows users to ask and answer questions, upvote answers, and send tips in the form of a custom ERC20 token called "goflow."<br/>
2.To facilitate the token's use, created an automated market maker smart-contract in Solidity with a user-friendly interface, enabling users to mint and swap between MATIC and "goflow" tokens.<br/>
3.To ensure seamless user experience, employed React-ContextAPI for effective state management and Chakra-UI for an intuitive interface.<br/>
4.In addition, four more smart-contracts were developed in Solidity, and Hardhat and EthersJs were utilized for deployment, testing, and interaction with the smart-contracts deployed on the Polygon Blockchain.<br/>


# Features:
1 allowed users to ask and answer questions, upvote answers, and send tips in the form of a custom ERC20 token called "goflow".<br/>

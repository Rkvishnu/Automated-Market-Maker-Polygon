# Web3-QnA-Forum-with-Polygon-AMM

#About:
1.A web3 version of the popular platform "Stake-Overflow" that allows users to ask and answer questions, upvote answers, and send tips in the form of a custom ERC20 token called "goflow."
2.To facilitate the token's use, created an automated market maker smart-contract in Solidity with a user-friendly interface, enabling users to mint and swap between MATIC and "goflow" tokens.
3.To ensure seamless user experience, employed React-ContextAPI for effective state management and Chakra-UI for an intuitive interface.
4.In addition, four more smart-contracts were developed in Solidity, and Hardhat and EthersJs were utilized for deployment, testing, and interaction with the smart-contracts deployed on the Polygon Blockchain.


Features:
1 allowed users to ask and answer questions, upvote answers, and send tips in the form of a custom ERC20 token called "goflow".
2.enabling users to mint and swap between MATIC and "goflow" tokens.
